# Sincript

<img width="178" height="97" alt="{4166AFF4-89CF-41C6-84E0-CC0A51EE1796}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92274647-6952-4a5b-a115-0fe5c40d10f2" />

A single, menu-driven batch script (`PerfTweaks.cmd`) that applies a
**curated, reversible** set of performance, privacy, and maintenance tweaks for
**Windows 10 and Windows 11**.

Everything is opt-in from a menu, every registry change is backed up before it
is made, and the script can create a System Restore Point and a full registry
export on request. There is no silent "apply everything" — you choose what
runs.

The script also detects at startup whether it is running on a **laptop or a
desktop** (ACPI battery presence — one registry query, no WMI/PowerShell; shown
as `Machine=` on the main menu and in the log). Actions that are typically
counterproductive on the detected machine class — the always-on power plan,
hibernation off, BCD dynamic-tick off, and the timer-resolution autostart on
laptops; `LargeSystemCache` on desktops — print an **`[ADVISORY]`** line before
their confirmation prompt. The **SysMain** toggle works the same way against a
different probe: it checks what the Windows disk actually is (SSD vs mechanical)
and warns first, because SysMain genuinely helps a spinning disk. That check asks
the drive directly — *does it incur a seek penalty*, which is literally the
SSD-vs-spinning question and what Windows itself uses — rather than going through
the Storage WMI cmdlets, which fail on more machines than you'd expect (one faulty
vendor storage provider takes the whole namespace down with it, and OEM laptops
ship those as standard). Advisories are informational only: they never block an
action, never change a default, and never alter what a preset applies.

The **runtime** is a single self-contained `PerfTweaks.cmd` (no installer, no
dependencies). The release also ships optional bundled inputs, a
timer-resolution helper, an example custom preset, and a developer test
harness — see [Release contents](#release-contents).

---

## Release contents

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `PerfTweaks.cmd` | The tool — copy this anywhere you want to run it |
| `SetTimerResolution.exe` | Optional timer-resolution helper for the action |
| `boot.config`, `hosts` | Optional inputs for the Unity and hosts actions (place next to the script) |
| `sincript_presets/` | Folder for custom `.preset` files; includes `example.preset` |
| `tests/` | Static-analysis harness (`Run-Tests.ps1`) — for development/CI, not needed on end-user PCs |

---

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or Windows 11 (tested on recent builds, including 24H2 / build 26100).
- **Administrator rights** for the full feature set. The script **auto-elevates**: on launch it requests elevation through UAC and relaunches itself elevated. Approve the prompt for HKLM changes, services, BCD edits, restore points, and similar.
- If you **decline UAC** (or elevation probes are unavailable), the script warns and asks whether to continue in **limited mode** — only per-user (HKCU) tweaks and read-only status screens work reliably there; privileged actions report `[WARN]` instead of a misleading `[OK]`.
- No installation beyond copying the files you need.

## How to run

1. Place `PerfTweaks.cmd` anywhere (Desktop, a USB stick, etc.).
2. Double-click it (or right-click → *Run as administrator*).
3. Approve the UAC prompt.
4. Use the number keys to navigate the menu, then press `Enter`.

> **Recommended first step:** open **`8. Backups & status`** and create a
> **System Restore Point** and/or a **full registry backup** before applying
> anything.

### Sub-menus
- **Cleanup & repair** — Disk cleanup (with an optional, irreversible clear of **all Event Viewer logs**) · SFC + DISM repair (their native progress output now streams live to the console) · Windows Update reset · re-register Microsoft Store · compact WinSxS.

  Every delete in the cleanup is anchored on an environment variable (`%TEMP%`,
  `%SystemRoot%`, `%LocalAppData%`), and each of those is **checked before anything
  is deleted**: it has to be set, point at a folder that exists, and not be a drive
  root. Anything that doesn't check out is skipped, out loud. That guard is there
  because batch doesn't complain about an unset variable — it expands to nothing —
  so on a machine with a broken environment `del /f /s /q "%TEMP%\*.*"` would
  quietly become `del /f /s /q "\*.*"`: a recursive delete from the root of the
  drive. Quoting the paths doesn't help; the quotes are intact, it's the contents
  that collapsed.
- **Network & DNS** — Apply TCP tweaks (autotuning, RSS/RSC; optional **Nagle / delayed-ACK off** for lower latency, and optional **Delivery Optimization off** so Windows Update stops uploading files to other PCs) · DNS menu (Cloudflare, Google, Quad9, or back to automatic/DHCP) · reset network stack.
- **Apps & files** — Install OpenAsar · apply a Unity `boot.config` · apply a custom `hosts` blocklist · restore the original `hosts` · install **SteamLight** (a lightweight Steam launcher + Desktop shortcut) · apply/remove a higher **timer resolution** (SetTimerResolution autostart) · remove built-in Store apps (**debloat**) · **manage startup programs** (flip Run-key and Startup-folder entries between Enabled and Disabled via the same reversible `StartupApproved` switch Task Manager uses; the prior state is saved to a `.reg` backup before every flip).
- **Advanced** — Disable/enable CPU mitigations · set/revert boot (BCD) timers · NVMe feature flags · disable IPv6 · disable memory compression · disable GPU telemetry (NVIDIA telemetry tasks + registry, or the AMD User Experience Program opt-out) · GPU hardware scheduling (HAGS) on/off · set a permanent per-program CPU priority (per `.exe`, via Image File Execution Options).
- **Presets** — Apply a built-in **light**, **moderate**, or **heavy** preset (no per-item prompts) · apply a **custom** preset from a `.preset` file · **restore** the registry values a preset changed from one of its JSON backups.
- **System tools** — **Edit PATH** (System or User) with dead-entry and duplicate cleanup · **Find what is locking a file** and optionally close the holder. Both are described under [System tools](#system-tools).
- **Backups & status** — Create a System Restore Point · export HKLM + HKCU · restore from a preset JSON backup · restore a single value backup (`.reg`) · manage/open the backup folder · show the current state of key tweaks, the active power plan, hibernation, minimum processor state, DNS, TCP autotuning, GPU hardware scheduling (HAGS), memory compression, the `hosts` line count, and whether OpenAsar is installed.

---

## Presets

**`10. Presets`** applies a whole bundle of tweaks in one go, with **no
per-item prompts** (only a couple of yes/no questions — restore point, and DNS
choice where relevant). There are three built-in presets plus your own custom
presets.

| Preset | What it applies | DNS |
|--------|-----------------|-----|
| **Light** | Cleanup core (temp/log cleanup, DNS flush), privacy/telemetry core, network core (TCP autotuning, RSS/RSC). Nothing risky. | Asks (Cloudflare / Google / Quad9 / skip) |
| **Moderate** | The full **recommended safe set** (cleanup + privacy + performance + power + network cores) — same as menu item 9. Optionally installs OpenAsar (bundled `app.asar` if present, otherwise downloads the latest nightly). | — (uses the safe set; DNS unchanged) |
| **Heavy** | Everything in the safe set **plus** foreground/latency tuning: `SystemResponsiveness = 0`, network throttling off, `Win32PrioritySeparation = 42`, Game Mode off, Nagle off, IPv6 off, NVMe flags, GPU telemetry off, BCD timers, memory compression off. | Asks (Cloudflare / Google / Quad9 / skip) |

**Heavy deliberately does *not* include** CPU-mitigation changes,
network-stack reset, system repair (SFC/DISM), debloat, `LargeSystemCache`, or
the timer-resolution autostart — those stay manual under their own menus. Heavy
shows a warning and offers a restore point first.

### Preset backups (JSON)

Manual menu actions each write their own tiny `.reg` backup. **Presets are
different:** every registry value a preset changes is recorded into **one JSON
file** in `Documents\PerfTweaks_Backups`, named `Preset_<name>_<random>.json`.
The script prints the exact path when the preset finishes.

To put those registry values back, use **`8. Backups & status → 4. Restore
from a preset backup (JSON)`** (also reachable from the Presets menu). It reads
the JSON and, per value, either restores the previous data or deletes the value
if it didn't exist before.

> The JSON backup covers **registry values only**. The non-registry parts of a
> preset — power plan, DNS, BCD timers, services/scheduled tasks — are reverted
> from their own menus (see *Reverting changes*). A System Restore Point
> (offered before moderate/heavy) rolls back everything at once.

## Custom presets

You can define your own preset as a small text file and have the script apply
it.

1. Create a folder named **`sincript_presets`** next to `PerfTweaks.cmd`.
2. Put a text file in it ending in **`.preset`** (e.g. `mypreset.preset`). A ready-to-edit **`example.preset`** ships with Sincript.
3. Run **`10. Presets → 4. Custom preset`**, pick your file, review the summary, and confirm.

### File format

- One directive per line, written as **`key=value`**.
- **No spaces around the `=`** (`cleanup=1`, not `cleanup = 1`).
- Start each directive in **column 1** (no leading spaces).
- A line beginning with **`#`** or **`;`** is a comment and is ignored.
- **Inline comments are not supported** — put comments on their own lines, not after a value.

### Keys

| Key | Value | Effect |
|-----|-------|--------|
| `cleanup` | `1` | Cleanup core (temp/log cleanup, DNS flush) |
| `privacy` | `1` | Privacy/telemetry core |
| `performance` | `1` | Performance core (GameDVR off, game-task priorities, UI timings) |
| `power` | `1` | Power core (Ultimate/High plan, no sleep/disk timeouts) |
| `network` | `1` | Network core (TCP autotuning, RSS/RSC) |
| `openasar` | `1` | Install OpenAsar silently (bundled `app.asar` if present, otherwise downloads the latest nightly) |
| `gamemode_off` | `1` | Disable Windows Game Mode |
| `systemresponsiveness` | `0` | `SystemResponsiveness = 0` (favor foreground) |
| `networkthrottling_off` | `1` | Network throttling off (`0xFFFFFFFF`) |
| `largesystemcache` | `1` | Enable `LargeSystemCache` *(situational; can hurt on desktops)* |
| `minprocstate5` | `1` | Minimum processor state 5% |
| `bcdtimers` | `1` | BCD timer set (`useplatformclock` off, `useplatformtick`/`disabledynamictick` on, TSC enhanced) |
| `ipv6_off` | `1` | Disable IPv6 (`DisabledComponents = 0xFF`) |
| `memcompress_off` | `1` | Disable memory compression *(raises RAM pressure on low-memory PCs)* |
| `nvme_flags` | `1` | NVMe feature flags *(may be blocked on fully-patched Windows)* |
| `gpu_telemetry_off` | `1` | Disable GPU telemetry (NVIDIA tasks + opt-out; opt-out on AMD) |
| `nagle_off` | `1` | Disable Nagle on all interfaces (`TcpAckFrequency` / `TCPNoDelay`) |
| `win32priority` | `42`, `38`, `26` or `2` | `Win32PrioritySeparation`. **`42`** (0x2A) = short **fixed** quantum — the classic "42" tweak; because the quantum is fixed, Windows' Processor-Scheduling dialog reads it back as *background services* (that's what fixed means, not a bug). **`38`** (0x26) = short **variable** quantum, strong foreground boost — the exact value Windows' own *Programs* radio writes; the foreground app gets the longer slice. **`26`** (0x1A) = long fixed quantum. **`2`** = Windows default. `42` and `38` are opposite trade-offs (throughput vs foreground latency); pick to taste. |
| `dns` | `cloudflare`, `google`, or `quad9` | Set DNS on all active adapters |

Keys not listed here (and `1`-keys given any other value) are **rejected**.

### What happens with a bad file

The script validates the whole file first and shows a summary: how many
directives it recognized and how many problems it found, each listed
(`unknown key`, or `bad value … (expected …)`). Then:

- **Some valid, some bad** → it reports the problems and asks whether to apply the valid ones anyway.
- **Nothing valid** → it aborts without changing anything and points you back to this key list.

Like the built-in presets, a custom preset writes a single JSON registry backup
you can restore from the Backups menu.

---

## System tools

**`12. System tools`** holds general-purpose tools rather than tweaks. They
change nothing on their own — you read first, then decide.

### Edit PATH

Edits the **System** (`HKLM`, all users, needs Administrator) or **User**
(`HKCU`, just you) `PATH`.

- Lists `PATH` as numbered entries and flags any folder that no longer exists as
  **`[missing]`** — the dead entries worth clearing out.
- Add a folder, remove one by number, drop **all** dead entries, or clean
  duplicates.
- **It never uses `setx`.** `setx` is documented to crop a value at 1024
  characters — a real machine `PATH` is routinely longer, so it would silently
  destroy most of it — and to rewrite `REG_EXPAND_SZ` as `REG_SZ`, freezing
  `%SystemRoot%`-style references into literal paths. Sincript reads the **raw**
  value and writes it back as `REG_EXPAND_SZ`, so both the length and the `%VAR%`
  references survive.
- The whole `Environment` key is backed up to a `.reg` (via `reg export`, which is
  exact for `REG_EXPAND_SZ`) **before** any edit — and if that backup can't be
  written, **the edit doesn't happen**. A `PATH` you can't put back isn't worth the
  risk.
- After a change it broadcasts `WM_SETTINGCHANGE`, so new programs and shells see
  the new `PATH` without a sign-out. Programs **already open keep the old value**
  until they restart — expected, and the tool says so.

Editing the System `PATH` needs an elevated window. If you aren't elevated,
sincript says so up front and offers the User `PATH` instead, rather than letting
the save fail.

### Find what is locking a file

Answers *"what has this file open?"* when Windows won't let you delete or replace
something, using the Windows **Restart Manager** — the same API installers use.

- Give it a full file path; it lists every process holding the file (PID + name).
- Core Windows processes are marked **`[critical]`** using Windows' own
  classification, and sincript **will not close them** — a reboot is the only
  safe way to release a file they hold.
- Closing a holder is optional, one process at a time, and confirmed. It loses
  that program's unsaved work but does not delete the file; sincript then
  re-checks and tells you whether the file is actually free.
- No reboot and no extra downloads: `openfiles` needs a global flag *and* a
  reboot before it reports anything, and Sysinternals `handle.exe` would be an
  external dependency — so neither is used.

---

## Safety & backups

The script is built around being undoable.

- **Per-value registry backups.** Before changing any registry value, the script saves a small `.reg` file with **only that one value's previous state** to `Documents\PerfTweaks_Backups` (~1 KB each). Double-click it to put the value back. Values containing quotes or empty `REG_SZ` data are backed up in a form that restores correctly; filenames use a wide random suffix so two values under the same key can't overwrite each other's undo file in one pass. Re-applying a value already at the target is skipped, so a redundant apply can't overwrite its original backup.
- **Full registry export** (optional) — exports all of `HKLM` and `HKCU` to `Documents\PerfTweaks_Backups`. It verifies both exports actually produced a file before reporting success, so a failed or partial backup (not elevated, or the folder isn't writable) is flagged `[ERROR]` instead of a misleading `[OK]`.
- **System Restore Point** (optional) — created on demand; `Apply recommended safe set` also offers to make one first.
- **Log file** — every action is logged to `Documents\PerfTweaks_Backups\PerfTweaks_<random>.log` as a clean `[timestamp] EXEC / OK / FAIL` timeline. It records each command's *outcome*, not its raw output, so it stays readable and doesn't fill with deleted-file paths or (on non-English Windows) garbled OEM-code-page error text.
- **Honest status lines.** Registry-heavy actions finish with `[OK]` only when every write succeeded; otherwise `[WARN]` with a count and inline `[FAIL]` lines pointing at what didn't apply (usually: not elevated, or a protected key). DNS, full-registry backup, OpenAsar, preset JSON restore, and admin-only repair actions (DISM/SFC, Windows Update reset, WinSxS compaction, memory compression) follow the same principle. The **apply hosts** action refuses to overwrite the system `hosts` file until a backup has landed.

All backups and logs live in **`Documents\PerfTweaks_Backups`** inside your user
**Documents** folder. The script auto-detects the real Documents path
(including OneDrive-redirected Documents) and falls back to
`%USERPROFILE%\Documents` if needed.

## Reverting changes

| Change | How to undo |
|--------|-------------|
| Any single registry tweak | Double-click its `.reg` backup in `Documents\PerfTweaks_Backups`, or use Backups & status → **Restore a single value backup (.reg)** |
| CPU mitigations | Advanced → **Enable mitigations** |
| Boot (BCD) timers | Advanced → **Revert BCD timers** |
| DNS | Network → DNS → **Automatic (DHCP)** |
| Custom `hosts` | Apps & files → **Restore hosts** |
| Timer resolution | Apps & files → **Remove timer resolution** |
| Windows Game Mode | Settings → Gaming → Game Mode (or merge the value backup) |
| Minimum processor state | Control Panel → power plan → set back to 100% |
| Removed built-in apps (debloat) | Reinstall from the Microsoft Store |
| Startup entry enabled/disabled | Flip it again under Apps & files → **Manage startup programs**, merge its `.reg` backup, or use Task Manager → Startup apps |
| Memory compression | PowerShell: `Enable-MMAgent -MemoryCompression` |
| A `PATH` edit | Double-click the `PATH` `.reg` backup written before the edit (in `Documents\PerfTweaks_Backups`) |
| SysMain / Superfetch | Merge its `.reg` backup, or `sc config SysMain start= auto` |
| Storage Sense / Delivery Optimization / CPU power throttling | Merge each one's `.reg` backup (they are policy values; the backup restores "not configured") |
| Windows AI (Copilot / Recall) | Merge their `.reg` backups, or restore the preset JSON backup |
| Telemetry firewall block | Elevated PowerShell: `Set-NetFirewallRule -Group DiagTrack -Action Allow` |
| Telemetry scheduled tasks | Task Scheduler → find the task → **Enable**, or PowerShell: `Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName <name> \| Enable-ScheduledTask` |
| Registry values changed by a preset | Backups & status → **Restore from a preset backup (JSON)** (or run the relevant menu item to reverse it) |
| Everything at once | Roll back to the **System Restore Point**, or import the **full registry backup** |

---

## Optional bundled files

Some actions can use files placed **next to `PerfTweaks.cmd`**. They are
optional:

- **`app.asar`** — an OpenAsar build for the Discord action. If absent, the script offers to download the latest nightly from the official OpenAsar GitHub releases (https://github.com/GooseMod/OpenAsar).
- **`boot.config`** — a Unity engine boot configuration applied to a game's `*_Data` folder.
- **`hosts`** — an ad/telemetry blocklist that the "apply hosts" action installs (the original is backed up first).
- **`SetTimerResolution.exe`** — the timer-resolution helper from [valleyofdoom/TimerResolution](https://github.com/valleyofdoom/TimerResolution). *Apps & files → Apply timer resolution* copies it to `C:\ProgramData\Sincript`, registers a hidden logon task that holds your chosen resolution, and (on Windows 10 2004+/11) sets the registry switch that makes the change system-wide.

**SteamLight** needs no bundled file. *Apps & files → Install SteamLight* finds
your Steam folder via the registry, writes a `SteamLight.bat` launcher **into
that folder**, and adds a `SteamLight` Desktop shortcut. The launcher starts
Steam with resource-saving flags (single process / single core, no shaders, no
shared textures, no Big Picture, high-DPI off, etc.) for lower RAM/CPU use. It
references `steam.exe` relative to its own folder, so it keeps working even if
Steam is on another drive. To change the flags, edit the single `_SLFLAGS=`
line.

## Recent changes

Newest first. Feature details live in the sections above — this is just what
changed.

- **System tools (menu 12).** New **PATH editor** — System or User, lists entries, flags dead ones, add / remove-by-number / drop-dead / de-duplicate — and **find what is locking a file** (Restart Manager: lists every holder, marks critical Windows processes and refuses to close them, optional confirmed per-process close, checks for parens in paths). The PATH editor never uses `setx` (it crops at 1024 characters and freezes `%SystemRoot%` into literal paths), backs up the whole value first, and broadcasts the change so new programs see it without a sign-out. Guarded by tests 31–42, 55.
- **Privacy: Windows AI off by policy.** Copilot (user *and* machine policy), **Recall** (enablement blocked, snapshot saving off, data analysis off), **Click to Do**, plus inking/typing personalization and online speech recognition. It rides along everywhere privacy is applied — menu 3, *Apply recommended*, and every preset — through the same backed-up, reversible path. The Privacy screen now also states two things it previously implied away: `AllowTelemetry=0` is only honored on Enterprise/Education (**Home and Pro clamp it to Basic, 1**), and stopping DiagTrack also stops **Xbox achievement sync and the Feedback Hub**. Guarded by tests 43–46.
- **More optional knobs.** *Performance:* Storage Sense off · Windows Search classic scope · **SysMain/Superfetch off**, which first probes the Windows disk and warns before the prompt if it looks like a mechanical HDD. *Power:* CPU power throttling off. *Network:* Delivery Optimization off. *Privacy:* four more telemetry scheduled tasks — looked up **by name** and reported as *found vs disabled* instead of a blind "done" — plus an optional **firewall block** for the telemetry service that flips Windows' own DiagTrack rules. Guarded by tests 47–50.
- **Three popular tweaks verified against Microsoft's documentation and declined** — regrouping svchost (`SvcHostSplitThresholdInKB`), lowering `ServicesPipeTimeout`, and disabling the prefetcher. They are listed with their reasons on *What was excluded*, and test 51 fails if any of them is ever quietly added back.
- **Static test harness expanded to 56 checks** — every new detector verified against a deliberately broken copy.
- **Elevation works when the script path contains an apostrophe** (e.g. `C:\Users\O'Brien\`) — the UAC relaunch now passes `%~f0` via `$env:PT_SELF` instead of embedding it in `Start-Process -FilePath '…'`, where a `'` broke the string and killed the relaunch with no prompt.
- **Per-value backups decline non-ASCII string data instead of corrupting it.** Undo files are written with `echo` (console code page), so non-ASCII `REG_SZ` *prior data* came back as mojibake; such values are now marked *not auto-restorable — use the full backup* (like `REG_BINARY`) and skipped on preset restore. The full `reg export` still restores them correctly.
- **Idempotent registry writes.** Applying a value already at the target prints `[SKIP] … already set` and returns **before** writing a backup, so a re-run or re-applied preset can't bury the true-original undo.
- **Safe defaults on confirmation prompts.** Each `(Y/N)` gate clears its variable first, so a bare **Enter** = *skip* rather than a stale `Y` (restore-point prompts default to **Yes**). This stops the irreversible **clear-all-Event-Viewer-logs** step firing from a stray Enter.
- **Cleaner log file.** `:Run` logs only `[timestamp] EXEC / OK / FAIL`, not raw command output (which dumped file paths and garbled OEM-code-page errors on non-English Windows). Outcomes are still recorded.
- **SteamLight reports honestly.** `[OK]` is gated on the launcher `.bat` actually being written, so an unwritable Steam folder (e.g. under `Program Files` without elevation) yields `[ERROR]` instead of false success.
- **Honest registry-action reporting.** Registry-heavy actions/presets track a failure tally, print inline `[FAIL]`, and finish via `:Summary` with `[OK]`/`[WARN]`; `:Run` counts failure only when genuinely not elevated. Guarded by tests 13–15, 24–25, 27.
- **Limited mode when UAC is declined.** On failed elevation the script sets a not-elevated flag, explains HKLM/service/boot changes won't work, and asks to continue per-user-only; repair actions gate their final line on elevation. Guarded by tests 17, 28.
- **Preset parser empty-value guard.** A `key=` line with no value no longer aborts the script. Guarded by test 16.
- **hosts apply requires a backup first** — confirmed landed before overwriting the system `hosts`. Guarded by test 18.
- **Preset JSON restore honesty + quote-safe REG_SZ.** `[WARN]`/`[ERROR]` on partial/unreadable backups; `REG_SZ` restores via `Set-ItemProperty` so quotes survive. Guarded by tests 19, 23.
- **OpenAsar targets the newest Discord build by version**, not folder-name order (which could pick an older build after a digit rollover). Guarded by test 20.
- **Per-value backup integrity.** Quotes in prior `REG_SZ` data are escaped, empty values handled, and filenames use `%RANDOM%%RANDOM%` so two values under one key can't collide. Guarded by tests 21–22.
- **SteamLight handles apostrophes in the Steam path** via an environment variable. Guarded by test 26.
- **Static test harness expanded to 28 checks** (`tests/Run-Tests.ps1`, dependency-free PowerShell 5.1; `tests/README.md` lists each) — now also guarding honest reporting, elevation, backup integrity, and preset restore.
- **Startup programs manager (Apps & files).** New *Manage startup programs* item lists the `Run` keys (HKCU, HKLM, HKLM-WOW64) and both Startup folders and flips entries **Enabled**/**Disabled** via the reversible `StartupApproved` switch Task Manager uses. Nothing is deleted; each flip saves prior state to a tiny UTF-16 `.reg` backup (so non-ASCII names restore), and one PowerShell worker with a fixed sort order flips localized (e.g. Cyrillic) names exactly. Guarded by test 12.
- **Fixed: restoring/resetting the hosts file crashed the script.** An unescaped `)` in `(AV tamper protection?)` inside a one-line `if ( ) else ( )` ended the block early and aborted the batch (*"was unexpected at this time"*) after the file was already written. The parens are escaped and test 9 (cmd block-parse simulation) now catches any unescaped `)` in a block.
- **Fixed: the Ultimate power plan never activated, and clones piled up.** `powercfg -duplicatescheme` with no destination GUID minted a random-GUID copy each run while `/setactive` targeted the canonical GUID, so the High Performance fallback activated and a clone accrued per power-core run. Duplication now targets the canonical GUID itself. Guarded by test 10.
- **Fixed: a failed OpenAsar download could install a broken file.** `Invoke-WebRequest` can leave a partial file, and both paths only checked existence; they now trust the child exit code and delete the leftover first. Guarded by test 11.
- **No more false "success" messages (first wave).** The **full registry backup** confirms both `HKLM` and `HKCU` exports wrote a file (else `[ERROR]`); **DNS apply/reset** counts adapters changed vs failed (e.g. `3 adapter(s), 0 failed`); **OpenAsar** reports which backup was saved, since AV / Controlled Folder Access often blocks the copy into Discord's own folder.
- **Performance: a `Win32PrioritySeparation` choice** — `1` = 42 (0x2A, short fixed quantum — the classic tweak; the Windows dialog will show *background services*, because a fixed quantum treats all apps equally), `2` = 38 (0x26, short variable quantum — the value Windows' *Programs* radio writes, foreground gets the longer slice), `3` = 2 (Windows default — undoes a previous 42 or 38), `N` = unchanged. One mutually-exclusive prompt, so its single-value `.reg` backup captures the true prior value rather than one just written.
- **Prefetch is no longer cleared** — it's placebo (Windows rebuilds it) and against the script's own stance; removed from cleanup/recommended/presets and listed on **What was excluded**.
- **Backup-folder manager (Backups & status).** New *Manage / open backup folder* item summarizes `Documents\PerfTweaks_Backups` by category (counts + MB), opens it in Explorer, and offers a safe prune of **older full-registry exports** while keeping the newest pair. The small `.reg` and preset-JSON undo data is never deleted.
- **In-app single-value restore (Backups & status).** New *Restore a single value backup (.reg)* item lists per-value `.reg` backups (newest first) and re-imports your pick, logged; full-registry exports (`FullReg_*.reg`) are filtered out. The preset-JSON restore is unchanged.
- **Per-app CPU priority (Advanced).** New *Set permanent process priority* pins a per-`.exe` priority (High / Above normal / Normal / Below normal / Low) via Image File Execution Options (`CpuPriorityClass`), reversible with *Remove override*. Target the `.exe` that actually runs (Task Manager → Details); Realtime isn't offered.
- **Reversibility + WinUtil tweaks.** Nagle and the per-user sync-services disable are now backed up, and the status helper is hardened against a `>` in registry data. Added opt-in items: mouse acceleration off, show file extensions, and **Activity History** off (`PublishUserActivities` / `UploadUserActivities`).
- **GPU hardware scheduling (HAGS).** New Advanced toggle for `HwSchMode` (reversible; needs a reboot and Windows 10 2004+ with a supporting GPU). Kept out of presets because turning it off disables features like NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation.
- **AMD telemetry opt-out.** The GPU-telemetry action and `gpu_telemetry_off` key now also opt out of the **AMD User Experience Program** (backed up), pointing to AMD Software → Preferences. Previously a no-op on AMD.
- **Status screen + localization.** Adds hibernation, minimum processor state, HAGS and memory compression (read-only), and — with DNS apply/reset — no longer depends on English output: it reads registry/cmdlet properties, filters TCP via `netsh` on the `:` separator (dodging `Get-NetTCPSetting` where `MSFT_NetTCPSetting` is missing), and applies DNS to all physical adapters. Works on Cyrillic Windows.
- **Presets, custom presets & JSON backups.** New **`10. Presets`** menu (light / moderate / heavy + custom `.preset` files), each writing one restorable JSON backup; *What was excluded* moved to item 11.
- **Console-font fix.** The last two inline-PowerShell spots (Unity core detection, `boot.config` rewrite) use the minimized-window pattern; boot.config paths pass via environment variables.
- **Community-guide tweaks.** BCD timers also set `useplatformtick yes`; optional minimum processor state 5%; optional Game Mode off; a *debloat* action (apps reinstallable from the Store).
- **Timer resolution.** SetTimerResolution installs as a hidden logon task plus a system-wide registry switch (needs a reboot); fully removable.
- **Backups moved to Documents** (`Documents\PerfTweaks_Backups`, OneDrive-aware) instead of the drive root.
- **Console compatibility (Windows 10 / Server 2022).** ASCII-only / no BOM, echo-off guard, working-directory fix, suppressed `mode`/`color` errors, ASCII logo — so `@echo off` and the menu render on legacy `cmd.exe`.
- **Unity `boot.config` is CPU-aware** — sets `job-worker-count` / `-maximum-count` to logical processors − 1 before copying into the game's `*_Data` folder.
- **Bundled-file error handling.** Missing/empty `boot.config` or `hosts`, and copy failures, now stop with a clear message.

## Notes & caveats

- **Run as administrator.** HKLM changes, services, scheduled tasks, BCD edits, and restore points all need elevation. The script elevates itself; approve UAC for the full toolset. In limited mode after declining UAC, expect `[WARN]` on privileged actions — intentional honesty, not a bug.
- **Backups go to your Documents.** They're written under the account that is elevated. On a normal single-admin PC (UAC consent prompt) that's your own Documents; if you elevate with a *different* administrator account, they land in that account's Documents instead.
- **A reboot is recommended** after several tweaks (memory compression, mitigations, NVMe flags, boot timers, timer resolution) for them to fully take effect.
- **Brief minimized windows.** Some actions (DNS, Store re-register, OpenAsar download, restore point, the status screen) run PowerShell in a short-lived minimized window so the main window's font/colors aren't disturbed. The flicker is normal.
- **The "Advanced" menu is genuinely advanced.** A few highlights:
  - *Disable CPU mitigations* trades security hardening (Spectre/Meltdown-class) for speed. Only do this where you understand the trade-off.
  - *NVMe feature flags* may be blocked by Microsoft on fully-patched systems; the script tells you so.
  - *Disable memory compression* frees a little CPU but increases RAM pressure on low-memory PCs.
- **Opt-in only.** Riskier items such as disabling mitigations and enabling `LargeSystemCache` are never part of the "recommended safe set" — you must select them yourself.
- **Console appearance.** The script uses a magenta theme and a small "SIN" logo. It runs in your default console font (Consolas on most systems) and changes no system-wide console, scaling, or registry settings beyond the tweaks you choose.

## "What was excluded" — the philosophy

The in-app **`11. What was excluded`** screen lists, by category, the popular
"tweaks" this script intentionally omits — for example security-weakening
changes (disabling Defender, the firewall, UAC, or SmartScreen), placebo or
obsolete registry values, clearing the Prefetch folder (Windows just rebuilds
it, slowing the next few launches), firewall rules that block Google/YouTube IP
ranges, hard-coded MTU values, and bulk undocumented GPU dumps. It also covers
items from popular gaming guides that are deliberately skipped — Windows
activation scripts, replacing Defender with a third-party antivirus, aggressive
RAM / standby "cleaners", and forcing MSI mode or NIC parameter edits (which the
experienced guides themselves advise against). Read it to understand the safety
rationale.

Three tweaks other optimizers ship were checked against Microsoft's own
documentation and left out on the evidence:

- **Regrouping svchost services** (`SvcHostSplitThresholdInKB`). Windows splits
  services into separate processes above 3.5 GB of RAM *on purpose*: Microsoft
  documents the benefits as reliability, **inter-service isolation**, per-service
  resource management and clearer diagnostics — and describes the footprint saving
  from regrouping as *modest*. Isolation is worth more than the RAM, so this sits
  under security-weakening alongside VBS/HVCI.
- **Lowering `ServicesPipeTimeout` to 30000.** 30 seconds already *is* the
  Service Control Manager's default, so the write changes nothing — and `60000` is
  the well-known **fix** people apply when a service legitimately needs longer to
  start, so applying this would silently undo it.
- **Disabling the prefetcher** (`EnablePrefetcher=0`). The same cost as clearing
  the Prefetch folder — which this script already declines, because the next
  launches just get slower — only permanent, and for close to nothing on an SSD.
  SysMain on/off is offered separately, under Performance.

## Tests

Sincript ships with a **static-analysis** harness in `tests/`. `PerfTweaks.cmd`
is interactive and changes the system, so it can't be safely unit-tested by
*running* it; instead `tests/Run-Tests.ps1` (56 checks on stock Windows
PowerShell 5.1 — no Pester) parses the script text for invariants that tend to
break silently, including:

- every menu `goto` / `call` resolves to a real label
- no unescaped `)` inside a `( )` block (cmd parser simulation — that class of bug crashed the hosts restore)
- no duplicate `boot.config` keys; `example.preset` keys match the in-script validator
- honest reporting (`:Summary`, `_FAILS`, elevation gating, DNS/OpenAsar/backup guards) does not regress
- backup undo integrity (quote escaping, collision-resistant filenames, hosts backup-before-overwrite)
- the PATH editor never invokes `setx`, keeps `REG_EXPAND_SZ`, and backs up before writing
- the lock finder refuses to close processes Windows marks critical
- advisories (laptop, desktop, disk) stay warning-only and appear **before** their prompt
- the tweaks listed on *What was excluded* are never quietly written back
- every cleanup delete is gated on a proven root, so an unset variable can never collapse `"%TEMP%\*.*"` into `"\*.*"`

Run from the repository root:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tests\Run-Tests.ps1
```

Exit code `0` means all 56 checks passed; `1` means at least one failed, with
the offending detail printed. See `tests/README.md` for the full numbered list.

## Disclaimer

Use at your own risk. These tweaks modify system settings; while the script
backs up each change and can create a restore point, you are responsible for
your system. **Make a restore point and/or a full registry backup first** (the
script provides both). Sincript is an independent utility and is not affiliated
with or endorsed by Microsoft, NVIDIA, AMD, Discord, or any other vendor
mentioned.
